# FILES

File is a collection of pages, each containing a collection of records.

Many alternative file orgranizations exists, each is good for some situations, and not so good in others.

- Heap Files have no particular order among the records.

  They are suitable when the typical access is a file scan retrieving all records.

  They are also feasible for inserting records.

- Sorted Files: pages and records within pages are ordered by some condition

  Best for retrieval (of a range of records) in some order

  They are also feasible for finding and manipulating some records.

- Index File Organizations

  Special data structure that has the fastest retrieval in some order

## Heap Files

Simplest file structure, contains records in no particular order

As file grows and shrinks, disk pages are alloacted and de-allocated

Fastest for **inserts** compared to other alternatives

## Sorted Files

Similar structure like heap files (pages and records), but pages and records are ordered.

Fast for range queries, but hard for maintenance( each insert potentially reshuffles records )

DBMS model the cost of all operations

The cost is typically expressed in **the number of page accesses** (or disk **I/O operations** - to bring data from disk to memory)

1 page access (on disk) == 1 I/O (used interchangeably)

# INDEXES

Sometimes, we want to retrieve records by specifying the values in one or more fields.

An index is a data structure built on top of data pages used for efficient search. The index is built over specific fields called **search key fields.**

**Any** subset of the fields of a relation can be the search key for an index on the relation.

*Search key* is not the same as *key*.

---

An index contains a collection of **data entries**, and supports efficient retrieval pf **data records** matching a given search condition.

# INDEX CLASSIFICATION

Classification based on various factors:

- Clustered vs. Unclustered
- Primary vs. Secondary
- Single Key vs. Composite
- Indexing technique: Tree-based, hash-based, other

## Clustered vs. Unclustered

If order of data records is the same as the order of index data entries, then the index is called clustered index. Otherwise is unclustered.

Zoom in a clustered index

A data file can have a clustered index on at most **one search key combination**(i.e. we cannot have multiple clustered indexes over a single table)

Cost of retrieving data records through index varies greatly based on whether index is clusted. (cheaper for clustered)

Clustering indexes are more expensive to maintain (require file reorganization), but are really efficient for **range search.**

Approximated cost of retrieving records found in range scan:

1. Clustered: cost $$\approx$$ $$\#$$ of pages in data file with matching records
2. Unclustered: cost$$\approx$$ $$\#$$ of matching index data entries (data records)

## Primary vs. Secondary Index

- **Primary** index includes the tableâ€™s **primary key**
- **Secondary** is any other index

Properties:

- Primary index never contains duplicates
- Secondary index may contain duplicates

## Composite Search Keys

An index can be built over a combination of search keys

Data entries in index sorted by search keys

Examples:

1. Index on $$<age, sal>$$
2. Index on $$<sal,age>$$

## Hash-based Index

Hash-based index

- Represents index as a collection of buckets. Hash function maps the search key to the corresponding bucket.

  $$h(r.search\_key) =$$  bucket in which record $$r$$ belongs

- Good for **equality** selections

---

Summary

- Hash-based indexes only good for equality search
- Sorted files and tree-based indexes best for range search; also good for equality search.
- Files rarely kept sorted in practice; B+ tree index is better.
