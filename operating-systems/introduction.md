# Introduction

**Evaluation Criteria of operating systems:**

*   Reliability

    Avalibility

    MTTF (mean time to faliure)

    MTTR (mean time to repair)
*   Security

    Enforcement: how the operating system ensures that only permitted actions are allowed
*   Portability

    A portable abstraction doesn’t change as the hardware changes

    AMI (abstract machine interface): the interface provided by operating systems to applications

    API (applicaiton programming interface): a key part of AMI

    HAL (hardware abstraction layer): an operating system implement independent of the hardware details
*   Performance

    Overhead: the added resource cost of implementing an abstraction

    One way to measure eﬃciency (or inversely, overhead) is the degree to which the abstraction impedes application performance.

    Throughput: the rate at which a group of tasks can be completed

    Predictability: whther the system’s response time or other performance metric is consistent over time

    A proprietary system vs. an open system

Modern operating system: time-sharing
