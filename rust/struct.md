# Struct

## Defining and Instantiating Structs

```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}
```

Note that the entire instance must be mutable; Rust doesn’t allow us to mark only certain fields as mutable. As with any expression, we can construct a new instance of the struct as the last expression in the function body to implicitly return that new instance.

The `email` and `sign_in_count` is of type `String`. We want each instance of the struct owns all of its data. If we use a `&str`, the variables are not owned by the struct instance.

```rust
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
  User {
    active: true
    username,
    email,
    sign_in_count: 1,
  }
}
```

It uses  *field init shorthand* syntax.

```rust
fn main() {
    // --snip--

    let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        ..user1
    };
}
```

This is struct update syntax. The `..user1` must come last to specify that any remaining fields should get their values from the corresponding fields in `user1`, but we can choose to specify values for as many fields as we want in any order, regardless of the order of the fields in the struct’s definition.

Note that this is a **move**. We can no longer use `user1` as a whole as a whole after creating `user2`.

In this example, we can no longer use `user1` as a whole after creating `user2` because the `String` in the `username` field of `user1` was moved into `user2`. If we had given `user2` new `String` values for both `email` and `username`, and thus only used the `active` and `sign_in_count` values from `user1`, then `user1` would still be valid after creating `user2`. Both `active` and `sign_in_count` are types that implement the `Copy` trait, so the behavior we discussed in the [“Stack-Only Data: Copy”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#stack-only-data-copy) section would apply.

### Tuple Structs

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
}
```

## An Example Program Using Structs

```rust
struct Rectangle {
  width: u32,
  height: u32,
}

fn main() {
  let rect1 = Rectangle {
    width: 30,
    height: 50,
  };
  
  println!(
  	"The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
     area(&rect1)
  );
}

fn area(rectangle: &Rectangle) -> u32 {
  rectangle.width * rectangle.height
}
```

To print out the structure we can use an output format called `Debug`.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!("rect1 is {:?}", rect1);
}
```

We can use `{:#?}` instead of `{:?}` in the `println!` string for larger structs.
